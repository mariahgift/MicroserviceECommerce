# MicroserviceECommerce
E29 Design your own microservice


Using your previous e-commerce project, break down implemented functionalities and create microservices for them. Design them according to the microservice principles: single - responsibility, built around business capabilities and design for failure.

No need for new implementations but consider that your project is for a large scale usage.
