# MicroserviceECommerce
E29 Design your own microservice


Using your previous e-commerce project, break down implemented functionalities and create microservices for them. Design them according to the microservice principles: single - responsibility, built around business capabilities and design for failure.

No need for new implementations but consider that your project is for a large scale usage.

20 Points
Coding Repository Based
Add a readme.md file in your codes which contain a description about your design and answers the following questions:

What are the functionalities involved, and the microservices you've created
Why do you think that the functionality needs to be isolated from another service.
Please commit your codes to your repositories.
